Welcome to SED Machine's documentation!
=======================================

The SED Machine is very low resolution (:math:`\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}\sim100`) optical (365 - 1,000 nm) integral field (30"x"30") spectrograph and a rainbow imager with a 13' x 13' field. The rainbow camera images are partitioned into u, g, r, and i bands, each with a 6' x 6' field of view. The instrument was designed for rapid classification of supernovae from PTF. To achieve this goal, the instrument was designed to have:

- Low resolution (:math:`R=\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}\sim100`), sufficient for classification.
- High "Slit to detector" photon throughput.
- 0.1 mag precision spectrophotometry.

The hardware project was funded by the NSF with a grant to Caltech and executed by Nick Konidaris (Principle Investigator), Robert Quimby (Project Scientist), Jack Davis, and Sagi Ben-Ami (Weizzman institute grad student). Continued work has been performed by Nadejda Blagorodnova (RCam photometry pipeline), Richard Walters (instrument control), and Don Neill (IFU spectroscopy pipeline).

Here we document the instrument for observers and developers.  Observers will want to refer to the Quick Reference below.
